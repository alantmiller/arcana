## What's Next (Optional Future)

If you want to enhance later:
- [ ] Add camera controls (OrbitControls) to demos
- [ ] More elaborate particle effects
- [ ] Text geometry for actual symbol shapes (instead of cubes)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between encoding stages
- [ ] Mobile optimization (reduce particle count)
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
